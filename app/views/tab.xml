				<Label class="help">Like on Android, Tabs on iOS now have 'selected' and 'unselected' events. See the Console for the payload.</Label>

				<Label class="help tpad">Also note that the introduction of these events on the TabGroup in 5.1 has been reverted. Just use 'focus' and 'blur' as you did before.</Label>

				<Label class="help tpad">On iOS you can now change the position of the tab icon. See the TSS to see how we moved the icon down a bit.</Label>
